# Phase 5.1: Issues Needed to Be Fixed — Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Fix UAT blockers — map pan/zoom blocked after route selection (Vaul overlay issue), back button hid the sheet permanently, no way to clear a selected route, and search strip competed with the sheet for screen space.
**Verified:** 2026-02-20T07:23:36Z
**Status:** HUMAN_NEEDED — all automated checks PASS; 5 runtime/visual items need browser confirmation
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | DirectionsSheet is Vaul-free (no pointer-blocking overlay) | ✓ VERIFIED | Zero `vaul`/`Drawer.` imports in file; pure `<section>` with `fixed inset-x-0 bottom-0` — no full-screen overlay |
| 2 | Map can pan/zoom while sheet is open | ? HUMAN NEEDED | Sheet is `inset-x-0 bottom-0` (260px peek height) not full-viewport; no `inset-0` overlay; `touch-none` only on drag handle row — visual confirmation needed |
| 3 | `handleSheetBack` calls `routeSelection.clearAll()` (not `setSheetOpen(false)`) | ✓ VERIFIED | Line 213–216 of FloorPlanCanvas.tsx: `const handleSheetBack = useCallback(() => { routeSelection.clearAll() }, [routeSelection])` |
| 4 | `sheetOpen` prop is passed to `SearchOverlay` | ✓ VERIFIED | FloorPlanCanvas.tsx line 251: `<SearchOverlay selection={routeSelection} nodes={nodes} onRouteTrigger={handleRouteTrigger} sheetOpen={sheetOpen} />` |
| 5 | SearchOverlay has `sheetOpen` prop that collapses to pill | ✓ VERIFIED | SearchOverlay.tsx line 38: `sheetOpen?: boolean`; lines 155–170: when `isCompact && sheetOpen`, renders "Route active" pill with `ClearIcon` calling `selection.clearAll()` |
| 6 | Clear (✕) button in compact strip calls `selection.clearAll()` | ✓ VERIFIED | SearchOverlay.tsx line 203–209: `<button onClick={() => selection.clearAll()} aria-label="Clear route"><ClearIcon /></button>` in non-sheetOpen compact strip |
| 7 | campus-graph.json corridor-aligned (junction-a=0.5,0.5; junction-c=0.32,0.5; hallway-2=0.68,0.5) | ✓ VERIFIED | `node` validation output: `junction-a: 0.5 0.5`, `junction-c: 0.32 0.5`, `hallway-2: 0.68 0.5`; 25 nodes, 30 edges |
| 8 | Route follows corridors visually | ? HUMAN NEEDED | Node coordinates confirmed correct; visual result requires browser inspection |
| 9 | TypeScript compiles clean | ✓ VERIFIED | `npx tsc --noEmit` exits 0 with no errors |

**Automated score:** 6/6 structural/wiring checks VERIFIED (2 require human visual/interaction testing)

## Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| `src/client/components/DirectionsSheet.tsx` | Vaul-free custom CSS sheet | ✓ VERIFIED | 505 lines; imports: `react`, `@shared/pathfinding/types`, `@shared/types`, `useRouteDirections` — zero Vaul/Drawer imports; renders `<section>` with `fixed inset-x-0 bottom-0` and CSS `height` transition |
| `src/client/components/FloorPlanCanvas.tsx` | `handleSheetBack` clears route; passes `sheetOpen` to SearchOverlay | ✓ VERIFIED | Lines 213–216: `handleSheetBack` calls `routeSelection.clearAll()`. Line 251: `sheetOpen={sheetOpen}` passed to `<SearchOverlay>`. Line 348: `onBack={handleSheetBack}` passed to `<DirectionsSheet>` |
| `src/client/components/SearchOverlay.tsx` | `sheetOpen` prop, pill collapse, clear button | ✓ VERIFIED | `sheetOpen?: boolean` prop at line 38; pill branch at lines 155–170 when `isCompact && sheetOpen`; clear button in non-sheet compact strip at lines 203–209 |
| `src/server/assets/campus-graph.json` | Corridor-aligned node coordinates; 25 nodes, 30 edges | ✓ VERIFIED | All 5 nav junction/hallway nodes on corridor centerlines: `junction-a(0.5,0.5)`, `junction-b(0.5,0.32)`, `junction-c(0.32,0.5)`, `hallway-1(0.5,0.22)`, `hallway-2(0.68,0.5)` |

## Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|-----|--------|---------|
| `DirectionsSheet` (custom `<section>`) | Konva Stage drag handler | No full-screen overlay; `touch-none` only on drag handle | ✓ STRUCTURAL | Sheet is `inset-x-0 bottom-0` (height-limited), not `inset-0`; the upper 65%+ of screen is unobstructed. `touch-none` is scoped to the 32px drag-handle row only (line 393). Runtime browser test still needed. |
| `FloorPlanCanvas.handleSheetBack` | `routeSelection.clearAll()` | `useCallback` directly calls `routeSelection.clearAll()` | ✓ WIRED | Line 214 direct call; `useEffect` at line 205–210 clears `routeResult` and `sheetOpen` when selections become null |
| `FloorPlanCanvas.sheetOpen` | `SearchOverlay` `sheetOpen` prop | JSX prop `sheetOpen={sheetOpen}` | ✓ WIRED | Line 251: prop threaded through. `SearchOverlay` consumes it at lines 53, 155. |
| `SearchOverlay` compact strip `isCompact && sheetOpen` | "Route active" pill render | Conditional branch in `if (isCompact)` block | ✓ WIRED | Lines 155–170: `if (sheetOpen) { return <div>Route active pill</div> }` — separate from full A→B strip. Both have `ClearIcon` calling `selection.clearAll()`. |
| `campus-graph.json` node coords | `RouteLayer` pixel points | `buildRoutePoints` in FloorPlanCanvas: `imageRect.x + n.x * imageRect.width` | ✓ WIRED | Lines 219–231: correct multiplication; node coords verified at corridor centerlines |

## Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| `DirectionsSheet.tsx` | 393 | `touch-none` on drag handle | ℹ️ Info | Correct and intentional — prevents browser scroll interference during drag gesture; scoped to 32px handle row only, does not affect the canvas above |
| `DirectionsSheet.tsx` | 376 | `window.innerHeight` called at render time | ℹ️ Info | Minor — `expandedHeight` computed synchronously from `window.innerHeight` without a resize listener; will be stale if orientation changes while sheet is expanded, but re-computing on open (via `useEffect`) would reset it. No functional blocker. |

No blockers or warnings found.

## Human Verification Required

### 1. Map Pan/Zoom with Sheet Open

**Test:** Select two landmarks → route calculates → directions sheet peeks up. While the sheet is showing, drag the map in the canvas area (upper portion of screen). Also try scroll/pinch to zoom.
**Expected:** Map pans and zooms freely. Sheet stays in position. No gesture is blocked.
**Why human:** Pointer-event pass-through (no `inset-0` overlay confirmed structurally) still needs real touch/mouse event verification in the browser.

---

### 2. Route Line Follows Hallway Corridors

**Test:** With a route displayed, zoom in on the route line.
**Expected:** The blue dashed line travels through the grey hallway areas. No segments cut visually through colored room blocks or wall boundaries. Try Main Entrance → CS Lab and Main Entrance → Library.
**Why human:** Node coordinates are verified correct; whether they visually align with the floor plan image corridors requires pixel-level visual inspection.

---

### 3. Back Button Clears Route Entirely

**Test:** Select start+destination → sheet opens. Tap the back arrow (←) in the sheet header.
**Expected:** Sheet closes AND both A/B pins disappear from the map AND route line is gone. Tapping any landmark brings back single-pin mode (not a route). The search UI resets to dual search bars.
**Why human:** `routeSelection.clearAll()` → `useEffect` cascade clears `routeResult` + `sheetOpen` — side-effect chain verified structurally but needs interaction to confirm no state leak.

---

### 4. Clear (✕) Button in Compact Strip

**Test:** With a route active and the directions sheet closed (e.g., after previously opening+closing by dragging it back down), look at the top bar.
**Expected:** Full A→B strip is visible with Swap and ✕ buttons. Tapping ✕ clears both selections and resets to dual search bars.
**Why human:** Distinguishes between the compact strip's ✕ (non-sheetOpen path) and the pill's ✕ (sheetOpen path) — runtime state needed.

---

### 5. Strip Collapses to Pill When Sheet Opens

**Test:** Select a route → sheet peeks open → observe the top-left of the screen.
**Expected:** Instead of the full "A → B" compact strip, a small "Route active" pill appears top-left with its own ✕ to clear. No overlap with the sheet.
**Why human:** The `isCompact && sheetOpen` conditional branch is verified in code; runtime rendering and visual non-overlap need browser confirmation on a real device/window.

---

## Summary

All structural and wiring requirements for Phase 5.1 are satisfied in the codebase:

- **Vaul completely removed** from `DirectionsSheet.tsx` — zero imports, replaced with a custom `<section>` using `fixed inset-x-0 bottom-0` and a CSS `height` transition between peek (260px) and expanded (92vh) states. No full-screen overlay exists.
- **`handleSheetBack` correctly calls `routeSelection.clearAll()`** — the back button exits route mode entirely, with `sheetOpen`+`routeResult` cleared by an existing `useEffect` watcher.
- **`sheetOpen` prop is threaded** from `FloorPlanCanvas` to `SearchOverlay` — the overlay has a `sheetOpen?: boolean` prop and renders the "Route active" pill when `isCompact && sheetOpen`.
- **Clear (✕) buttons present** — both in the collapsed pill (sheetOpen path) and in the full compact strip (non-sheetOpen path), both calling `selection.clearAll()`.
- **campus-graph.json** verified: 25 nodes, 30 edges, all 5 corridor nav nodes on centerlines (junction-a: 0.5,0.5; junction-b: 0.5,0.32; junction-c: 0.32,0.5; hallway-1: 0.5,0.22; hallway-2: 0.68,0.5).
- **TypeScript** compiles clean (`tsc --noEmit` exits 0).

Two items — map pointer-event pass-through and visual corridor alignment — require browser confirmation because they depend on runtime gesture behavior and pixel-level visual inspection respectively.
